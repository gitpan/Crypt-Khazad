Crypt::Khazad
=============

Khazad is a 128-bit key, 64-bit block cipher. Designed by Vincent
Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, Khazad is a NESSIE finalist for
legacy-level block ciphers. Khazad has many similarities with Rijndael,
and has an extremely high rate of diffusion.

BONUS

The C file, _khazad.c, is a standalone Khazad implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _khazad.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.
